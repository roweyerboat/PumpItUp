# Pump_It_Up: Driven Data Competition
This Repo contains notebooks used to Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and iNterpret the data from the Pump It Up competition put on by Driven Data. https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/
The task is to create a model using machine learning that will predict whether a well in Tanzania is functional, not functional, or functional but needs repair.

## Files 
This repo contains:
- csv files for the data preprocessed and then processed

- the test set from the competition used to submit an entry in the competition

- a notebook that contains all the cleaning and exploratory analysis.  

- a folder of notebooks creating models for the ternary classification.  

- a folder contains my work on the problem using a binary classification of functional or needs repair.  

- an executive summary presentation showcasing my final models and my recommendations for those looking to invest in repairing wells.

## Updates
I've been working with this data in Tableau and digging a bit deeper into how to best classify.

This is one of the visualizations I was able to create to showcase the areas impacted by wells that need repair and the size of the population impacted.
