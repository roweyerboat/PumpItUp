# PumpItUp: Driven Data Competition
This Repo contains notebooks used to Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and iNterpret the data from the Pump It Up competition put on by Driven Data. https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/
The task is to create a model using machine learning that will predict whether a well in Tanzania is functional, not functional, or functional but needs repair.
This repo contains:
- a notebook that contains all the cleaning and exploratory analysis.  

- a folder of notebooks creating models for the ternary classification.  

- a folder contains my work on the problem using a binary classification of functional or needs repair.  

- an executive summary presentation showcasing my final models and my recommendations for those looking to invest in repairing wells.
